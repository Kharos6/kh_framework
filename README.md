  COMPATIBILITY
</h1>

* ace: All functions are designed to be compatible with ace, and will adjust their behaviour depending on whether ace is loaded or not.
* other mods: Likely compatible with just about everything else on the workshop, as this mod does not overwrite any original game behaviour or the behaviour of other mods. Explicitly tested with 3den Enhanced and Zeus Enhanced, with no incompatibilities found.

  NOTES
</h1>

- While the large majority of the functionality exposed in the form of Eden attributes or modules has been thoroughly tested, there is still a chance that some bugs flew under the radar. Reporting these issues is greatly appreciated.
- Due to multiplayer being the primary focus of this mod, testing missions in multiplayer mode is ideal, as singleplayer will misbehave in some circumstances. This may be changed in the future to allow for singleplayer mission creation, but is not a priority right now.
- Updates will be pushed based on volume or necessity. If major issues are found, an update will be pushed out to fix those issues as soon as possible. Otherwise, updates will be pushed out only when enough additions have been made to the mod to warrant an update.
- Must be installed on every machine and the server.
